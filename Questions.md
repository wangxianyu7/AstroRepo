### Planetary rotation 

 - Is it possible to measure the planetary rotation? 
 - From photometric or spectroscopic observations？
 - What dose they look like？
 - What does the distribution of them look like?
 - Ant astrophysical meaning? 
 - Different planetary rotation of planets in Solar System means what?  Primary thing I need to know!!!

### Climate changes and Astronomical sites selection
- How to impact the selection?
- Some stations will be unuseless due the gloabl warm effect?
- use this softwave to do some simulation will be interesting. https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/software/


### Lithium in star and planets
- Can we observe the significant diffenence bewteen planet and its host star? that means the planet was merged before.


### Diffuser things
- Can we train a D2NN and use 3D printer to print it out to replace Diffuser？

### exoplanet in open cluster

- Have there been any exoplanets discovered in globular star clusters?
- - simple answer is they are too far. see [this](https://astronomy.com/magazine/ask-astro/2021/03/ask-astro-have-there-been-any-exoplanets-discovered-in-globular-star-clusters).

### O' Connel in binaries

- May be related to mutual spin angle? If this is true, small effect should be shown in low mass ratio binaries.
