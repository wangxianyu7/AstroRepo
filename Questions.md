 - Is it possible to measure the planetary rotation? 
 - From photometric or spectroscopic observations？
 - What dose they look like？
 - What does the distribution of them look like?
 - Ant astrophysical meaning?

### Climate changes and Astronomical sites selection
- How to impact the selection?
- Some stations will be unuseless due the gloabl warm effect?
- use this softwave to do some simulation will be interesting. https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/software/


### Lithium in star and planets
- Can we observe the significant diffenence bewteen planet and its host star? that means the planet was merged before.


### Diffuser things
- Can we train a D2NN and use 3D printer to print it out to replace Diffuser？
